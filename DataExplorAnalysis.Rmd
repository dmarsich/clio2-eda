## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
congressionalcandidates <- read_csv("data/congressional-candidate-totals.csv")
congressionalcandidates
nrow(congressionalcandidates)
ncol(congressionalcandidates)
```
```{r}
str(congressionalcandidates)
```
```{r}
head(congressionalcandidates)
```
```{r}
tail(congressionalcandidates)
```

```{r}
elections <- read_csv("data/elections.csv")
elections
combo_elections <- 
  left_join(congressionalcandidates, elections, by = "election_id")
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = combo_elections) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = winner, color = party))

#This produced a visualization, but not necessarily a terribly useful one. My goal was to get a sense of election victories over time by year. The problem is expressing winner=TRUE.
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = combo_elections) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = party, color = winner))

```
```{r}
ggplot(data = combo_elections) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = total_vote, color = party, shape = winner))

#Here my goal was to explore which parties earned what totals by year. 
```
```{r}

```
